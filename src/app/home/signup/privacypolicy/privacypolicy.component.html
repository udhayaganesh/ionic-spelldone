        a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the
        world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable
        information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
        policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and
        to comply with this policy.<br> See more at: <a

      <label class="desc">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the
        backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they
        include have played a significant role in the development of data
        protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
        Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented
        is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
        personal information.</label>

        which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally
        enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail
        to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
        individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
        that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
        investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</label>
